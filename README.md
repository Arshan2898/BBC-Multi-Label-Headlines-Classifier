# BBC-Multi-Label-Headlines-Classifier
Business, entertainment, politics, sports, and technology are the five categories into which this multi-label classifier is designed to categorize BBC headlines. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, and embeddings are used in the model's construction. The NLTK and TensorFlow libraries were used in the Python development of the project.
Dataset:- Two news article datasets, originating from BBC News, provided for use as benchmarks for machine learning research. These datasets are made available for non-commercial and research purposes only.The dataset used for training the model consists of a collection of BBC headlines from 2004 to 2005. It contains a total of 2225 headlines, with each headline belonging to one or more of the five categories. The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 80:20.
